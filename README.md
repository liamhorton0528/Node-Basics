-Completely changed server.js
  * changed server.js to use express.js for all the routing

  * can now update user names
  * can now delete users

MINI-PROJECT-4 CHANGES:
- created promises for GET requests
  * error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added callback method that logs how many users have been listed whenever opening the users page
- The Node.js event loop is a constant loop that will read your code, find all the tasks that need to be completed and then completes them. Once it
  completes these tasks, it waits for new tasks to come in. If there is a delay for some tasks then it will wait to complete them until the specifed amount of time is over.
  For example, if you have a task in a function that has a 1 second delay on it and a task following that one that doesn't, the second task will be completed first because it gets added to the list of tasks
  that the event loop has to complete first whereas the first task waited a second to be added.
- Also realized I've been uploading stuff to github wrong this whole time so you will probably notice the folders being a little messed up
