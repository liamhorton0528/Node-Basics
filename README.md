# Node-Basics
- in the fileOperations.js file, a fs constant is being created that will be used to read our file which is simply named file.txt.
- using the method "readFile", we will read our file and have 2 props, err and data which will collect error info and the info from our file.
- if an error is detected, there is a text that will be printed in the console stating there was an error and what the error is.
- regardless of whether or not there is an error, the console will also log whatever data may have picked up
